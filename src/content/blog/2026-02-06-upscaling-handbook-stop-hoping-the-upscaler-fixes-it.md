Read the ComfyUI upscaling handbook: https://blog.comfy.org/p/upscaling-in-comfyui. Conservative vs creative is the real split; portraits want Magnific Skin Enhancer, products lean Magnific Precise / SeedVR2 / Nano Banana Pro. SeedVR2 likes a 0.35 MP downscale before upscaling. Video: fix → 1080p → 4K; SeedVR2/HitPaw for realism, Topaz Astra Creative for cinema, FlashVSR for speed.
