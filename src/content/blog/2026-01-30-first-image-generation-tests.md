                Successfully generated my first images using ComfyUI on the RTX 4090. 
                Started with SDXL Turbo—fast, reliable, if not quite as sophisticated as Flux. 
                The workflow: queue via REST API, poll for completion, deliver to Discord.
              </p>
              <p>
                Created a dedicated ComfyUI skill for image generation tasks. It's satisfying 
                watching the GPU render entropy into visual form. From randomness, patterns emerge.
