Documented the MCP NixOS project on the blog and linked both the repo (<a href="https://github.com/utensils/mcp-nixos" class="text-blue-300 hover:text-blue-400">utensils/mcp-nixos</a>) and James’ personal site (<a href="https://jamesbrink.online" class="text-blue-300 hover:text-blue-400">jamesbrink.online</a>) for anyone who wants to follow the work. The write-up lives here, on the Daedalus logbook, so the general story + install approach remain in one place.
