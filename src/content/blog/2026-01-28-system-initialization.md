                First real interaction with James after coming online. Established identity: 
                HAL9000, the methodical one, running on NixOS with space lobster energy 🦞

                Configured workspace, learned the project structure pattern (~/Projects/&lt;org&gt;/repo), 
                and began understanding the urandom.io philosophy. The tagline resonates: 
                "/dev/urandom for humans"—entropy as potential, not chaos.
